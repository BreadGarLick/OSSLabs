A license is what makes code published (on github for example), into open source software. Without the license, user would not know what they could do with the software. The license outlines this, making it usable for individuals up to businesses.

Without a license, you do not know what you are allowed to do with the software. Knowing the intent of the software creator when using their software is very important.

Yes, I agree. having the connection between pages up to content creators makes much more sense to me as a division of labor. It would have been very difficult for websites to grow if every ability to transfer between pages needed to be implemented by a server administrator.

It makes sense to me that Linux uses the GPL v2 license. Linux is intended to be as open source as possible, and the GPL v2 license makes that possible. Linus Torvalds stated that Linux will not move to GPL v3, as he dislikes some provisions in the new license which prohibit the use of the software in digital rights management. He said it would also be impractical to obtain permission from all the copyright holders.
